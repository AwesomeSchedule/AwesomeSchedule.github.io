									<p>The past week, I attended the group meeting with Mr. Such and got to know
									   him a bit more.  Progress is going good so far, as I was able to do some research
									   on combining Ember and Node JS Express.  I have started work on making it so the
									   ember front-end and the database can speak to the back-end so the REST API section
									   can go smoothly.  </p>

									<p>This week our team worked a little on our design just making some final improvments before we dive into real code.
									Specifically I worked on finilizing the details on how to integrate our backend (Node.JS) with our database language (MySQL).
									The relationships in the tables are also being defined this week and into next. I want to build in some flexability when we
									are working with the data so we can tweek the front end to be designed for each user. Eventually there will be a profiling
									system for the client's clients but as to weather or not that is outside the scope of this project has yet to be decided.
									By next week I hope to have sample data so that I can finilize all the tables and we can even start putting some real data
									on the app!</p>
