									<p> This past week included a lot of working together to get everything to come together.
									We collaborated in working through some communication issues that arose between the front and
									back-end of our project in addition to knocking out a solid testing plan. We want to make certain
									that we have provided our client with the best possible application we can, so we were thorough in
									discussing what is reasonable for us to complete in the weeks to come. Although there are still 
									some hurdles that we have left to overcome, we feel confident that we will be able to finish strong.</p>

									<p>I have made progress in interweaving the front-end and the back-end.
									   Working together with Joey and working closely together during one
									   session, we have implemented cookies.  This way, The web application
									   will now be able to tell who is logged in.  Once the log-in page is
									   finished, we can fine-tune the cookies before jumping into more difficult
									   tasks.  And of course, our team can work in security to make sure any
									   sensitive data is hidden within the cookies.</p>

									<p> Over the last week, I spent the majority of my time focusing in on the 
									testing plan. As a team, we discussed what was most important to our project
									and more importantly, to our client in terms of what should be laid out in our
									testing plan and I was able to put all of our ideas together in one document.It 
									is important to me that in the next few weeks we catch all the issues we possibly 
									can before handing the project over for the client to put to the test. 
								        We are working through some issues now, so the testing 
									phase is just beginning, but I will be reporting on any updates as we
									go through each of the tests laid out in our testing document. </p>

									<p> This week was about learning. Since the bulk of the remaining project is going to be connecting the api to the front end, I have been reading about various techniques to connect the two. This week I will be discussing with Michael about the possibility of using ember data for the requests. If the API isn't configured to work with ember data, then we will use AJAX requests to take care of it. We have also made a login page which will prompt the user to create an account before they can use the application.</p>
