									<p> During the past two weeks, our team has made good progress on our web application. 
									The front-end of our team was able to nearly complete the Calendar page and complete
									a good portion of the Coaches page as well. The back-end worked to further communication
									between the parts and will continue to do so in collaboration with the front-end. We also 
									have an upcoming meeting scheduled with our client to touch base and present what has been
									completed so far. </p>

									<p>I have made progress in interweaving the front-end and the back-end.
									   Working together with Joey and working closely together during one
									   session, we have implemented cookies.  This way, The web application
									   will now be able to tell who is logged in.  Once the log-in page is
									   finished, we can fine-tune the cookies before jumping into more difficult
									   tasks.  And of course, our team can work in security to make sure any
									   sensitive data is hidden within the cookies.</p>

									made some good progress on the Coaches page. This coming week we will likely continue
									to work on the Coaches page and work with Michael and Kevin to get all of the parts 
									communicating. </p>

									<p>This week we made the database live! We are having some trouble interfacing it with Node.js but the test
									data is responding as expected and the prewritten statments are performing the correct functions.
									The current challenge is to have live updates from the ember front end service and that should be up
									very soon. Next weeks greatest challenge will be gettting the entire site to perform all at once. I expect that
									we will have a few hang-ups reltated to the database as we figure out how to more efficiently put and pull
									the data we want and lay it out on the front end. The success of the coming weeks depends heavily on our
									team work this week.</p>

									<p> During the last two weeks, most of my work has been done styling the application. With the Calendar page and coaches page almost completely finished as far as CSS goes, it is now time to work on interacting with the database, and more complex user interactions like drag and drop. Since the admin page is going to so closely resemble these other two pages, I have decided to hold off on building it at all until later. The big question to come is how hard will the interaction with the full stack be, and will it affect any of the already in place styling? Overall I am very excited with where we are with the project, and am looking forward to completing what is left.</p>
