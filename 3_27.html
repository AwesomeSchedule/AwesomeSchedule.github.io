									<p> During the past two weeks, our team has made good progress on our web application. 
									The front-end of our team was able to nearly complete the Calendar page and complete
									a good portion of the Coaches page as well. The back-end worked to further communication
									between the parts and will continue to do so in collaboration with the front-end. We also 
									have an upcoming meeting scheduled with our client to touch base and present what has been
									completed so far. </p>

									<p>I have made progress in interweaving the front-end and the back-end.
									   Working together with Joey and working closely together during one
									   session, we have implemented cookies.  This way, The web application
									   will now be able to tell who is logged in.  Once the log-in page is
									   finished, we can fine-tune the cookies before jumping into more difficult
									   tasks.  And of course, our team can work in security to make sure any
									   sensitive data is hidden within the cookies.</p>

									to work on the Coaches page and work with Michael and Kevin to get all of the parts

									<p>This week I made more changes to the database and am preparing to commit those changes to the live database.
									These changes will help us to remain flexible for our clients future needs. Everything is going smoothly as we
									prepare to enter April. We are in the final stretch of the project and must begin the sprint. I am still continuing the
									profiling system for the coaches and I hope to have everything nailed down in the begining of the week.</p>

									<p> This week was about learning. Since the bulk of the remaining project is going to be connecting the api to the front end, I have been reading about various techniques to connect the two. This week I will be discussing with Michael about the possibility of using ember data for the requests. If the API isn't configured to work with ember data, then we will use AJAX requests to take care of it. We have also made a login page which will prompt the user to create an account before they can use the application.</p>
