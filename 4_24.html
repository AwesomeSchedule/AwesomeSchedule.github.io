									<p> This past week we collaborated to continue working through some communication issues that 
									arose between the front and
									back-end of our project in addition to finishing up our testing plan and reviewing it with Dr. Piwowarski. 
									We are going to focus our efforts on the last few finishing touches and then get to work on
									all of the testing that needs to be done before we hand over the product to our client after
									he reviews it. The end is in sight and we will work hard this week to get even closer to finishing up.

									<p>Since the last update, our team and I have made huge strides in the web application, especially in the calendar section of the website.
\									   I assisted the others in their parts while I coded up the routes in the Node back-end.  One
									   part that still needs to be looked at is fine-tuning the final documentation and modifying our power-point slides to be more acceptable for the final presentation.  We also need
									   to work in a demo that will allows us to present with enough time.  The loose ends in this project are going to be tied up and we'll have a working demo for the presentation!</p>

									<p> This past week I have spent my time divided, doing what needs to
									be done in order to tie up the loose ends of our web app. This mostly included
									fine-tuning the final documentation and starting on testing what was finished
									and available to test as well as preparing our slideshow for the presentation
									this coming week. I plan to finish up testing this week when everything is
									ready and put that into the documentation to be turned in as well as meeting
									with the team to run through our presentation some more and make the suggested
									changes from Friday's practice run.

 +									<p>So much was accomplished this week. We got calandars to work and all of the data from the database populates correctly.
 									There is not much left to complete in the final stretch of this project. Most of the core features have successfully been integrated.
 									During this final stretch I want to be sure that the database is working well and ready for Awesome Inc to take it over. I have
 									learned a lot while working on this project; much of it having to do with optimization but also teamwork. Our team worked very well
 									together this semester and I am saddened to see it end but I am excited to see the project standing on its own.</p>

									<p>We are getting closer to the end of the project. Profiles can be displayed with images and basic information, courses can be pulled from the database and displayed on the calendar where they should be, and users can login. We have a couple more items to knock out to finish the more in depth features of the calendar page, such as displaying all of the coaches, but once we finish that, it will be onto some of the more fun aspects like drag and drop. This week I am hoping to knock out the calendar page completely, and see where that will leave us with the coaches page. Our main struggles have been underestimation. Even with steady work on the project all semester, problems arose that held us back a lot more often than expected. Still, I am excited to present what we have done and continue working on it.</p>
