									<p> This past week we collaborated to continue working through some communication issues that 
									arose between the front and
									back-end of our project in addition to finishing up our testing plan and reviewing it with Dr. Piwowarski. 
									We are going to focus our efforts on the last few finishing touches and then get to work on
									all of the testing that needs to be done before we hand over the product to our client after
									he reviews it. The end is in sight and we will work hard this week to get even closer to finishing up.

									<p>Ember certainly is a fickle beast to tackle.  While we finally sorted out the communication issues that arose, it took up a lot of our time to develop a clear communication line.  Only this weekend was I able to dedicate time to the project due to two tests in the same week.  Plus, the struggle in having to figure out how Ember would talk to the API has certainly limited the features I can write to support the interactivity on the Front-End. If I don't yet know the info I'll be receiving for a specific feature, I can't code the route handlers for it. I have also spent time in commenting and adding documentation to the project for the upcoming code review. </p>

									<p> This past week I have spent my time divided, doing what needs to
									be done in order to tie up the loose ends of our web app. This mostly included
									fine-tuning the final documentation and starting on testing what was finished
									and available to test as well as preparing our slideshow for the presentation
									this coming week. I plan to finish up testing this week when everything is
									ready and put that into the documentation to be turned in as well as meeting
									with the team to run through our presentation some more and make the suggested
									changes from Friday's practice run.

 +									<p>The database is undergoing a pre-code review for clarity and making sure that we can connect properly to everyhting.
 +									We made sure that we could easily get from the front end to the database to pull data and that worked out great! I think we are
 +									a little more behind than we anticipated on being so we are having to double time all of our work before turning it in to the client.
 +									Before the end of the week I want to be able to display data in the calandar. I am optomisitc about where we are at but it will definantly
 +									need to be polished before we submit. Another thing that I did this week is to make seperate Delphi build files so that 
 +									when we build the database on seperate accounts (AWS or Delphi [uky]) we can do them quickly and without having to manualy remove
 +									syntax that different services don't like.</p>

									<p> Progress has been slow, but steady. This past week was the first time we have been able to make successful calls to the database without a ton of hassle. We have created an authentication system that redirects to the coach's page on a successful login attempt. Now the trick is going to be getting all of the necessary data pulled and displayed in the application. From there, we can begin to put the final touches on the special interaction features like drag and drop, and do any final testing.</p>
