									<p>After just completing the final design for the scheduling application, we have decided to take a little bit of time to work through available online courses to help us learn more about the tools we are using. We have selected the third party tools we will use to save time (such as an authentication service) and added these to our designs. This week, we will be focusing on presenting the application in class, as well as continuing to work on our respective parts to finish the project.</p>

									<p>I was successful in implementing the adapter so that the front-end can speak to
									   the node.js back-end with REST API requests with a specific namespace.  I foresee
									   working more closely with the rest of the team to help connect the database to
									   the front-end.  Also plan to look into the email system the client asked for.</p>

									<p> This past week I was able to finalize the designs to be posted on the team webpage. I also 
									put together the team powerpoint in preparation for the midterm presentation this upcoming week.
									The calendar page did not receive as much of my time as I had hoped and preparing for our presentation
									and our design took the majority of my time. This upcoming week I will be devoting some time to the 
									calendar page with Joey, giving our presentation and also completing my individual assignment. Any extra
									time will be used to learn more about Ember. </p>

									<p>This week we meet more than once as a team to go over our midterm presentation. We have gotten a lot accomplished
									and the app is progressing nicely. I was also given multiple data examples from Nick Such and was able to construct a
									MySQL database and ER diagram. I will be usign the ER diagram during our presentation on Wednesday to discuss how each
									entity and relationship contribute to the flow of the app and makes it flexible to change later on. This week was
									one of the most productive in terms of actually establishing a foothold into the app beyond just its design. In the
									coming weeks I expect that the database will be fully integrated with our app and the data flow will be smoothed out.</p>

									<p>Continuing the trend from the last few weeks, I am going to be continuing to work on the calendar page. At the end of last week we cleared up a lot of issues that had been holding us back from progressing as quickly as we would have liked. After spending a little more time learning, we should be able to move more quickly through this project and have a much more smooth process.</p>
