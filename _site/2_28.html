									<p>The past week, I spent more time learning about how to inter-mingle the technologies together.  One case
									   is whether to use promises or generators for asynchronous tasks. I plan on coding out the adapter so that
									   ember can talk to the NodeJS back-end.  </p>

									<p>This week we meet more than once as a team to go over our midterm presentation. We have gotten a lot accomplished
									and the app is progressing nicely. I was also given multiple data examples from Nick Such and was able to construct a
									MySQL database and ER diagram. I will be usign the ER diagram during our presentation on Wednesday to discuss how each
									entity and relationship contribute to the flow of the app and makes it flexible to change later on. This week was
									one of the most productive in terms of actually establishing a foothold into the app beyond just its design. In the
									coming weeks I expect that the database will be fully integrated with our app and the data flow will be smoothed out.</p>

									<p>This week I will be continuing to work on the calendar page. I have been working through issues getting third party tools integrated with ember. After I resolve these, the calendar should be finished relatively quickly. Once Michael gets the routing set up to communicate with Kevin's database, we can begin learning how to populate the calendar with events. Rebekah and I are also working on finishing the technical design for the front end. </p>
