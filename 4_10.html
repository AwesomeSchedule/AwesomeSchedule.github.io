									<p> This past week included a lot of working together to get everything to come together.
									We collaborated in working through some communication issues that arose between the front and
									back-end of our project in addition to knocking out a solid testing plan. We want to make certain
									that we have provided our client with the best possible application we can, so we were thorough in
									discussing what is reasonable for us to complete in the weeks to come. Although there are still 
									some hurdles that we have left to overcome, we feel confident that we will be able to finish strong.</p>

									<p>Progress had its momentum stopped when some issues arose related to the communication between the Ember Front-End and the Server-side API.  I have worked closely with Joey this weekend to help iron them out as much as they can.  As it is integral to get that squared away, that will be our full focus for the days to come.  The sooner we can get that worked out, the sooner we can start working on the other features.  One thing that I will intend to look at is Ember.JS's preference for a JSON format in the response it gets from the server.  Getting that perfected will make it easier for us in the long run.</p>

									<p> Over the last week, I spent the majority of my time focusing in on the 
									testing plan. As a team, we discussed what was most important to our project
									and more importantly, to our client in terms of what should be laid out in our
									testing plan and I was able to put all of our ideas together in one document.It 
									is important to me that in the next few weeks we catch all the issues we possibly 
									can before handing the project over for the client to put to the test. 
								        We are working through some issues now, so the testing 
									phase is just beginning, but I will be reporting on any updates as we
									go through each of the tests laid out in our testing document. </p>

									<p>The database is undergoing a pre-code review for clarity and making sure that we can connect properly to everyhting.
									We made sure that we could easily get from the front end to the database to pull data and that worked out great! I think we are
									a little more behind than we anticipated on being so we are having to double time all of our work before turning it in to the client.
									Before the end of the week I want to be able to display data in the calandar. I am optomisitc about where we are at but it will definantly
									need to be polished before we submit. Another thing that I did this week is to make seperate Delphi build files so that 
									when we build the database on seperate accounts (AWS or Delphi [uky]) we can do them quickly and without having to manualy remove
									syntax that different services don't like.</p>

									<p> This week has been a crunch getting the API working with ember. Nobody expected the process to be as involved as it has to far, and we are hoping to have it figured out soon. Until this issue is solved, it will be the main focus for me. Apart from that, I have spent some time reading about ember data vs ajax, which will give some insight on getting data to display in the front end.</p>
