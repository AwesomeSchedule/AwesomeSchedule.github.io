									<p> This past week we collaborated to continue working through some communication issues that 
									arose between the front and
									back-end of our project in addition to finishing up our testing plan and reviewing it with Dr. Piwowarski. 
									We are going to focus our efforts on the last few finishing touches and then get to work on
									all of the testing that needs to be done before we hand over the product to our client after
									he reviews it. The end is in sight and we will work hard this week to get even closer to finishing up.

									<p>Ember certainly is a fickle beast to tackle.  While we finally sorted out the communication issues that arose, it took up a lot of our time to develop a clear communication line.  Only this weekend was I able to dedicate time to the project due to two tests in the same week.  Plus, the struggle in having to figure out how Ember would talk to the API has certainly limited the features I can write to support the interactivity on the Front-End. If I don't yet know the info I'll be receiving for a specific feature, I can't code the route handlers for it. I have also spent time in commenting and adding documentation to the project for the upcoming code review. </p>

									<p> The majority of my time this past week has been devoted to testing. We spent time
									as a team laying out what we needed to test and how we would go about putting it 
									together, then I typed out all of the details. After receiving feedback from Dr. Piwowarski
									at our testing review, I then made the necessary changes and worked on the charts to be completed
									once the testing is finished. These charts will be included in the final documentation that I
									also began putting together this week. I will continue to work on it this upcoming week in addition
									to working with the team to finish up last minute details and really buckle down on all of the testing
									in the plan that we created.

 +									<p>The database is undergoing a pre-code review for clarity and making sure that we can connect properly to everyhting.
 +									We made sure that we could easily get from the front end to the database to pull data and that worked out great! I think we are
 +									a little more behind than we anticipated on being so we are having to double time all of our work before turning it in to the client.
 +									Before the end of the week I want to be able to display data in the calandar. I am optomisitc about where we are at but it will definantly
 +									need to be polished before we submit. Another thing that I did this week is to make seperate Delphi build files so that 
 +									when we build the database on seperate accounts (AWS or Delphi [uky]) we can do them quickly and without having to manualy remove
 +									syntax that different services don't like.</p>

									<p> This week has been a crunch getting the API working with ember. Nobody expected the process to be as involved as it has to far, and we are hoping to have it figured out soon. Until this issue is solved, it will be the main focus for me. Apart from that, I have spent some time reading about ember data vs ajax, which will give some insight on getting data to display in the front end.</p>
