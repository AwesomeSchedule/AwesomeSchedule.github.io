									<p> This past week included a lot of working together to get everything to come together.
									We collaborated in working through some communication issues that arose between the front and
									back-end of our project in addition to knocking out a solid testing plan. We want to make certain
									that we have provided our client with the best possible application we can, so we were thorough in
									discussing what is reasonable for us to complete in the weeks to come. Although there are still 
									some hurdles that we have left to overcome, we feel confident that we will be able to finish strong.</p>

									<p>Progress had its momentum stopped when some issues arose related to the communication between the Ember Front-End and the Server-side API.  I have worked closely with Joey this weekend to help iron them out as much as they can.  As it is integral to get that squared away, that will be our full focus for the days to come.  The sooner we can get that worked out, the sooner we can start working on the other features.  One thing that I will intend to look at is Ember.JS's preference for a JSON format in the response it gets from the server.  Getting that perfected will make it easier for us in the long run.</p>

									<p> The majority of my time this past week has been devoted to testing. We spent time
									as a team laying out what we needed to test and how we would go about putting it 
									together, then I typed out all of the details. After receiving feedback from Dr. Piwowarski
									at our testing review, I then made the necessary changes and worked on the charts to be completed
									once the testing is finished. These charts will be included in the final documentation that I
									also began putting together this week. I will continue to work on it this upcoming week in addition
									to working with the team to finish up last minute details and really buckle down on all of the testing
									in the plan that we created.

									<p> This week has been a crunch getting the API working with ember. Nobody expected the process to be as involved as it has to far, and we are hoping to have it figured out soon. Until this issue is solved, it will be the main focus for me. Apart from that, I have spent some time reading about ember data vs ajax, which will give some insight on getting data to display in the front end.</p>
