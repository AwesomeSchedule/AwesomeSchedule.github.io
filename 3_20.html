									<p>I was able to find a special weekeend deal for the entire team where they can
										watch courses for free in a website, which even featured an ember.js course.
										Most of my time was mostly spent thinking about the presentation and how to
										work with the database side of things.  I will be relying on cooperating
										with the rest of the team to help the website communicate with each of its
										parts.  Not to mention scheduling the majority of my time in Spring Break
										dedicated to working on the website.</p>

									<p> These past two weeks, I was able to meet up and collaborate with Joey to work on 
									the front-end of our web app. We are close to finishing the Calendar page and also 
									made some good progress on the Coaches page. This coming week we will likely continue
									to work on the Coaches page and work with Michael and Kevin to get all of the parts

									<p>This week our team met a few times to go over our practice midterm presentation and continue our design. Our practice midterm
									with the eStudio went well and we recieved great feedback. In terms of our app progress I was finally able to get the database
									out of the planning stage and into a kind of beta stage where I am still making changes but for the most part it is set. I
									expect in the coming weeks (especially over Spring break) we will all be fully integrated with eachother wherin changes to our
									code can affect the entire project so we will have to move forward cautiously.</p>

									<p>Continuing the trend from the last few weeks, I am going to be continuing to work on the calendar page. At the end of last week we cleared up a lot of issues that had been holding us back from progressing as quickly as we would have liked. After spending a little more time learning, we should be able to move more quickly through this project and have a much more smooth process.</p>
